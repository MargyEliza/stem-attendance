## Automated Attendance Tracking

A Python program designed to help teachers streamline attendance. With this program a teacher will no longer have to waste time on doing roll call for their students; instead, students will simply scan their IDs, which will mark them as present in the system. Along with this, if a student is late then they will be marked as late in the system.
